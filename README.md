# Rock-paper-scissors

Hello , this is my project for the rock-paper-scissors assignment.

I decided to use alerts in place of console logs because i think it makes it more interactive.

I also choose to use numbers instead of strings because it's much easy to program with numbers than with strings (please don't yell at me jeje)

I hope you enjoy playing and win against the computer!!

Good luck UWU
